# Bitcoin-wallet-balance-checker
This script allows you to check the balance of Bitcoin wallets listed in a file (wallet-addresses-list.txt). It queries the Blockchain.info API to fetch the balance of each wallet and provides the balance in BTC, USD, and INR. If a wallet has a balance greater than a specified threshold, it triggers a bell sound to alert the user.
